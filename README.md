## 🤖 What is this?
This is the code for the flight computer that I have made for my course's final project.
It consists of a embedded C software that runs into and ESP32 Microcontroller inside a water bottle rocket.
### It's pourpose
To log data in a SD card and transmit sensor readings wirelessly, as well as detecting the rocket's apogee (aka max height of the flight) and deploy a parachute right after it.
### Why
- Transmiting rocket telemtry data is essencial for more complex rocket flights. It's a powerful tool that helps understand the behaviour of the rocket.
- It's pretty cool actually be able to see what's happeing in a so popullar water bottle rocket.
- To demonstrate that it is possible to have this kind of device in any size model rocket.
